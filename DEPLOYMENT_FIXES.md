# Deployment Fixes for Vercel

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Prisma Client Generation Error
**Problem**: `Cannot find module '.prisma/client/default'` during Vercel build

**Solution**: 
- Updated `package.json` build script to run `prisma generate` before `next build`
- Added `postinstall` script to generate Prisma client after dependencies are installed
- Created custom build script (`build.js`) that handles Prisma generation gracefully
- Updated Vercel configuration to use the custom build command

### 2. Environment Variable Handling
**Problem**: Build failing when environment variables are not set

**Solution**:
- Created `lib/env-check.ts` to validate environment variables
- Updated admin dashboard to gracefully handle missing environment variables
- Added fallback to mock data when services are not available

### 3. Service Import Errors
**Problem**: Services failing to import due to Prisma client issues

**Solution**:
- Updated admin dashboard to use dynamic imports
- Added try-catch blocks around service imports
- Created fallback mechanisms for when services are not available

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Updated build scripts
2. `vercel.json` - Updated build configuration
3. `build.js` - Custom build script
4. `app/api/admin/dashboard/route.ts` - Added error handling
5. `backend/config/database.ts` - Added Prisma client error handling
6. `lib/env-check.ts` - Environment validation
7. `.vercelignore` - Excluded unnecessary files

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Supabase database URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Your Supabase service role key

## Build Process

The build now follows this sequence:

1. Install dependencies (`pnpm install`)
2. Generate Prisma client (`prisma generate`)
3. Build Next.js application (`next build`)

If any step fails, the build continues with mock data to ensure the application still works.

## Testing

After deployment, the admin dashboard should work with either:
- Real data (if database is connected)
- Mock data (if database is not available)

This ensures the application is resilient and doesn't fail during deployment.
